# Monarch Flappy Plane

Back in the day, I worked at Monarch Airlines, and one of the coolest things we did was hold regular "hack days"—basically sanctioned time to hit pause on our usual dev work and dive headfirst into whatever weird or wonderful tech experiments we fancied.

One particular hack day landed right before Christmas, and instead of doing anything remotely productive or career-advancing, we decided to have a bit of festive fun and build a game.

In a joint effort with Andrew Chambers, we cooked up *Flappy Plane*—a cheeky spin on the classic *Flappy Bird*, but starring a Monarch Airlines plane dodging an unusually crash-prone Santa (and, of course, the ground).

We didn’t touch any game engines—there simply wasn’t time for that kind of commitment. This beauty was hacked together in just 77 lines of raw JavaScript magic (okay, slightly more if you count the jQuery, but who’s counting?).

Is it perfect? Absolutely not.
Is it fun? Heck yes.

You can try it out right here (bonus points if you beat Santa):
